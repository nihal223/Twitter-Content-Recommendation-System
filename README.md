# Twitter-Content-Recommendation-System
A content recommendation system from links shared on twitter

### Tools
The main tools I used are Python and Neo4j, a graph database. 

* I used Python for fetching the data from Twitter, extracting keywords from the articles shared and for inserting the data into Neo4j.

* To find recommendations I used Cypher, the Neo4j query language.
